#Python Weather Scraping Tool

** This is a script that uses Selenium to scrape the NWS Web for weather in a text output **

How do I use it?

Quite simple - download the script, (works with Python 3.x) and run it. 
It will show you Weather for my location - Manchester NH USA. However, if you look in the script somewhere around line 33, I have
the URL for my location. If you want to go to the NWS webpage and find the URL for your location.

When you run it, it will print out the current weather and forecast for the next serveral days.

Seems to work best in Spyder - I'll investigate
